Setting up build systems is unnecessarily complicated. IDEs expose lots of 
individual settings in mysterious locations that can vary from release to
release. Command line build systems are plagued by poor documentation, ad hoc
scripting languages, and a relative lack of portability between platforms.

The focus of this book is on the architecture of our program, not on how it
is built. In that spirit, cmake has been selected as the simultaneously least 
broken and most portable of the command line systems as it is a meta-build
system - it builds reasonably functional build scripts in a platform's native
dialect, whether it be make files, xcode projects, or visual studio solutions.

We won't concern ourselves at the moment with the contents of the provided
cmake script, but to get started let's do two things.

First, let's generate a version of this file readable in a browser. At a
command line, type 
~~~~
stddoc < main.cpp > main.html
~~~~
Then open main.html in a browser. Next, at a development command line, go to 
a directoy you'd like to do your build in, I susggest a sibling to the gusteau
directory,and type

~~~~
mkdir gusteau-build-chapter-1
cd gusteau-build-chapter-1
cmake ../gusteau
~~~~
Note that for this to work properly on Windows, the development command line
must match the build you want. So run the Development Tools for x64 command
line that came with the version of visual studio you are using. The command
line for cmake on windows will actually need to look like -
~~~~
cmake ..\gusteau -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
~~~~

Similarly on mac, you'll need to use xcode-select to pick the compiler you
want cmake to use.

When cmake completes go ahead and build the resulting project.


Separate the state of the program from the user interface
Separate rendering from the state of the program
Program state should be updated via a channel
We'll make a control queue out of a std::deque, and for now, will encode our commands as strings.
~~~C++
#include <deque>
#include <string>

typedef std::deque<std::string> StateCommandQueue;

~~~
The user interface will issue a command by placing it in a channel
The state thread is waiting on the channel with a conditional WaitOne
It decants the command from the channel and runs it, and repeats until the channel is empty
The rendering thread renders on demand but doesn't block the UI thread
so the basic structure is a main that launches a UI thread, a state thread, and a render thread.
There must be an overall application context. It is composed of blocks which
can only be mutated by their owners.
The contexts for state, render, and UI context have private contents, hidden
in a detail class.
~~~C++
class StateContext
{
	struct Detail;
	Detail* m_{};
public:
	StateContext();
	~StateContext();
};

~~~
There's no need to use a unique_ptr for Detail, the context object destructor
is responsible for removing it. Using a unique_ptr requires exposing the
contents of the Detail class, and so must be globally available, or 
known to the context object destructor. Since the idea is to not make it
globally available, and since the context destructor will have to know 
about it anyway, the unique_ptr adds no value.

The detail objects can be lazily created by the state object when
needed. Having a simple pointer here makes the context object itself
lightweight and trivially constructable.
~~~C++
class RenderContext
{
	struct Detail;
	Detail* m_{};
public:
	RenderContext();
	~RenderContext();
};

class UIContext
{
	struct Detail;
	Detail* m_{};
public:
	UIContext();
	~UIContext();
};

~~~
Various systems are going to need access to the graphics context for
rendering.
~~~C++
class GraphicsContext
{
   struct Detail;
   Detail* m_{};
public:
   GraphicsContext();
   ~GraphicsContext();
};

~~~
The application context bundles the context objects, and the running state
of the application itself
~~~C++
class ApplicationContext
{
public:	
	ApplicationContext() = default;
	~ApplicationContext() = default;

   GraphicsContext root_graphics_context;
	StateContext state;
	RenderContext render;
	UIContext ui;

	StateCommandQueue state_commands;

	bool join_now{};
};

~~~
The state can only be communicated with via a fifo. The fifo is
writeable by any engine, and readable only by the state object.
That will be enforced by the interface to the StateCommandQueue.

The main program scopes an ApplicationContext and vector of threads that
exist for the duration of the program's run.

The threads themselves capture a reference to the ApplicationContext
and will exit when the join_now flag is set on the context.

~~~C++
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

GraphicsContext RootGraphicsContext();

~~~
It will be the job of the ui_engine to set the join_now flag on the context
which will let all the other engines know it's time to shut down.

We'll name the engines up front, and come back to them in a moment.
~~~C++
void StateEngine(ApplicationContext&);
void RenderEngine(ApplicationContext&);
void UIEngine(ApplicationContext&);

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
	ApplicationContext context;
   context.root_graphics_context = RootGraphicsContext();

	std::vector<std::thread> jobs;
	jobs.emplace_back(std::thread([&context]() { StateEngine(context); }));
	jobs.emplace_back(std::thread([&context]() { RenderEngine(context); }));
	jobs.emplace_back(std::thread([&context]() { UIEngine(context); }));
	for (auto& j : jobs)
		if (j.joinable())
			j.join();

	return 0;
}
~~~
Next, let's head over to the UIContext to see what's up.

The UIContext is going to hold everything the user can see, starting with
the window.
GLEW will provide the GL bindings.
~~~C++
#include <gl/GLEW.h>

~~~
For this demonstration, the window will be maintained by GLFW.
~~~C++
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

static void error_callback(int error, const char* description)
{
   fprintf(stderr, "Error %d: %s\n", error, description);
}

~~~
THe glfw flags should be set consistently and to a relatively modern version,
so a function will be provided up front for that.
Detail is going to maintain a root graphics context that all GL contexts
can share. This will be useful later when more than one rendering system
is in place.
~~~C++
void setGlfwFlags()
{
   glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 4);
   glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 3);
   glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);
#if __APPLE__
   glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GL_TRUE);
#endif
}

~~~
The GraphicsContext object will contain an invisible root window
with a GL context that can be shared with other GL windows and offscreen
render contexts, to enable sharing of resources like textures and
vertex data.
~~~C++
class GraphicsContext::Detail
{
public:
   Detail() = default;
   Detail(Detail&&) = default;
   ~Detail()
   {
       if (_window)
       {
           glfwDestroyWindow(_window);
       }
   }
   GLFWwindow* _window{};
};
~~~
The UIContext will contain the main user interface winow.
~~~C++
struct UIContext::Detail
{
   Detail()
   {
       // Setup window
   }

   GLFWwindow* _window {};
};
